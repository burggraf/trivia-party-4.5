Indexes:
    "questions_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
    "idx_questions_category" btree (category)
    "idx_questions_created_at" btree (created_at DESC)

```

**IMPORTANT**: Column "a" contains the correct answer; columns "b", "c", "d" contain incorrect answers.

### Question Selection & Preview
- Questions randomly selected based on categories and quantities
- Host can preview selected questions/answers before game starts
- Host can modify selections (remove questions, reorder answers, etc.)
- Host saves configuration and starts game at scheduled time

## Game Play

### Player Entry
Players join via:
- Game code provided by host
- QR code scan displayed on TV screens

### Team Management
- Players can create new team OR join existing team
- Teams support multiple players
- **Answer locking**: First submitted answer per team is final (no changes allowed)
- Teams must coordinate on single answer before submission

### Game Flow (Host-Controlled)
- Host advances to next question
- Host reveals correct answers
- Host displays scores/standings
- **One-way control**: Host browser controls all actions; player browsers are read-only

### Real-Time Communication
All updates transmitted via **Supabase Realtime broadcast channels**:
- Question display to TV screens
- Question sync to player devices
- Answer submissions
- Score updates
- Standings display

### Scoring & Results
- Track all team answers
- Calculate scores based on correct answers
- Display scores at:
  - End of each round
  - End of game
- Show final standings with winning team
- Visualize scores using charts/graphs for engaging display

## Authentication & Authorization

### Host Authentication
- Email/password authentication required
- Each host can only access their own games and data
- Hosts cannot view or manage other hosts' games
- Only the host who created a game can delete it

### Player Authentication
- **Option 1**: Create account with email/password
- **Option 2**: Anonymous login (just enter name) using Supabase anonymous authentication
- Both options available to players

## Answer Randomization

- Answers (a, b, c, d) must be shuffled for each question before display
- Shuffle order is identical for all players, teams, and TV displays
- Host preview shows the same shuffled order that players will see
- **Critical**: Column "a" in database is always correct, but display order must be randomized

## Timing Rules

### Time Constraints (Optional)
- Host configures time limits during game setup (optional)
- Time limits apply per question (not per round)
- When time expires: auto-advance to next question following normal game flow
- Countdown timer visible to players only if time limits are enabled

## Scoring System

### Points
- All questions worth 1 point (correct/incorrect, no partial credit)
- No speed bonuses

### Tie-Breaking
- If teams have equal scores: team with lowest total time taken to answer wins
- Track cumulative answer time for each team throughout game

## Game State Management

### Host Controls
- **Pause**: Host can pause game; screen shows "paused" state for all users
- **Resume**: Host can resume from paused state
- **Navigation**: Host can go back to previous questions if advanced accidentally
- **Early End**: Host can end game before all rounds complete; show final scores based on completed rounds
- **Question Preview**: Host can privately preview next question with option to replace it with another from same category

### Disconnection Handling
- If host disconnects: game pauses automatically until host reconnects
- Host can reconnect and continue from paused state

### Game Persistence
- Games can be saved and resumed at a later date
- Game state persists across sessions

## Team Management

### Team Size Limits
- Host specifies minimum players per team (minimum: 1 player)
- Host specifies maximum players per team (maximum: 6 players)
- Solo players allowed (team of 1)

### Team Rules
- Players cannot switch teams after joining
- Players cannot join once game has started
- Team names must be unique per game (no restrictions on content)
- If player misses questions (late join before game starts), missed questions count as incorrect

### Multi-Player Answer Submission
- First answer submitted per team is final and locked
- If multiple players submit simultaneously: first received wins, others ignored
- Subsequent submission attempts show message: "Your team has already answered"

## Data Persistence & History

### Game History
- All completed games saved permanently
- Hosts can view their past games with full details
- Players can view their game history (without seeing actual questions)

### Statistics Tracking
- Track team/player statistics over time across multiple games
- Metrics include: games played, win rates, accuracy, etc.

### Leaderboards
- Global or venue-based leaderboards available
- Rankings based on game performance

### Question Reuse Prevention
- **Critical**: Never repeat questions for a host
- Track all questions used by each host across all their games
- Exclude previously used questions when selecting random questions
- If category has insufficient unused questions: supplement from related categories

## Error Handling

### Player Disconnection
- Auto-reconnect attempts on connection loss
- Show "Reconnect" button if auto-reconnect fails
- Player rejoins same team automatically
- Questions missed during disconnection: no penalty (not counted as incorrect)

### Network Failures
- Retry answer submissions automatically on network failure
- Show loading states during retry attempts
- Display error message if submission ultimately fails

### Answer Conflicts
- First answer received per team is recorded
- Subsequent answers from same team ignored
- Show message to late submitters: "Your team has already answered"

## UI/UX Specifications

### Player Interface
- **Answer Display**: Show answer text only (no A/B/C/D labels)
- **Team Status**: Show which teammates are currently online/connected
- **Submission Status**: Show "Your team has answered" after answer submitted (don't reveal which answer)
- **Countdown Timer**: Display only if host enabled time limits

### TV Display
- **During Questions**: Show question and answers only
- **Team Count**: Show "X of Y teams have answered" during active questions
- **Before Game**: Show team names and initial scores (0)
- **End of Round**: Show team names, scores, and standings
- **End of Game**: Show final team names, scores, and winner

### Sound Effects (Optional)
- Host can enable/disable sound effects during setup
- Sounds for: time running out, answers locked, round complete, etc.

## Edge Cases

### No Answers Submitted
- If no teams answer a question: host still reveals correct answer, then advance

### Question Management
- Host can preview next question privately before displaying
- Host can replace upcoming question with another from same category
- Skipped/replaced questions don't count toward round totals

### Insufficient Questions
- If category lacks enough unused questions: auto-supplement from related categories
- Never repeat questions previously used by that host
- With 61,000+ questions, this should be rare

### Game Completion
- Host can end game early at any time
- Final scores calculated from completed rounds only
- Incomplete rounds not counted

## Technical Requirements
- Supabase Realtime for all client synchronization
- Real-time broadcast channels for state updates
- Mobile-responsive player interface
- TV-optimized display for questions/scores
- Host control interface for game management
- Supabase anonymous authentication for guest players
- Email/password authentication for hosts and registered players

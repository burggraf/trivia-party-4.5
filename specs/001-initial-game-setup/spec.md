## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

**Host Perspective:**
As a trivia host at a pub/restaurant venue, I want to create and manage trivia games so that I can run engaging trivia nights for patrons. I need to configure the number of rounds, select question categories, preview questions, and control the game flow in real-time while questions and scores display on TV screens for all participants to see.

**Player Perspective:**
As a trivia player, I want to join a team using my mobile phone by entering a game code or scanning a QR code, so I can participate in the trivia game. I want to see questions on my phone, submit answers, and view our team's progress without needing to look at the TV screen constantly.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Host Setup Flow
1. **Given** I am an authenticated host, **When** I create a new game with name "Monday Night Trivia", 3 rounds, 5 questions per round, and select categories "Sports" and "History", **Then** the system randomly selects 15 questions from those categories that I have never used before
2. **Given** I have configured a game, **When** I preview the selected questions, **Then** I see each question with its shuffled answer options in the same order that players will see
3. **Given** I am viewing the question preview, **When** I choose to remove a question or replace it with another from the same category, **Then** the system updates my game configuration accordingly
4. **Given** I have finalized my game setup, **When** I start the game, **Then** a unique game code is generated and displayed along with a QR code for players to join

#### Player Join Flow
5. **Given** the host has started a game, **When** I enter the game code or scan the QR code on my mobile device, **Then** I am prompted to either create a new team or join an existing team
6. **Given** I choose to create a new team with name "Quiz Wizards" and 4 maximum players, **When** I submit, **Then** my team is created and I enter the game lobby awaiting other players
7. **Given** another player wants to join my team, **When** they enter the game code and select "Quiz Wizards", **Then** they join my team if we haven't reached our maximum size or the game hasn't started
8. **Given** all teams have joined, **When** the host advances to the first question, **Then** all players see the question and answer options on their devices simultaneously

#### Gameplay Flow
9. **Given** a question is displayed to all players, **When** I select an answer and submit it, **Then** my answer is locked and other team members see "Your team has answered"
10. **Given** a team member has already submitted an answer, **When** I try to submit a different answer, **Then** I see the message "Your team has already answered" and my submission is rejected
11. **Given** a question has an optional time limit enabled, **When** the countdown timer reaches zero, **Then** the host's view automatically advances to reveal the correct answer
12. **Given** the correct answer is revealed, **When** the host advances to the next question, **Then** all players see the new question and can submit answers again
13. **Given** all questions in a round are completed, **When** the host displays the scoreboard, **Then** all players and TV screens show team names, scores, and current standings
14. **Given** all rounds are completed, **When** the host ends the game, **Then** final scores are displayed showing the winning team and all teams' rankings

#### Real-Time Synchronization
15. **Given** the host advances to a new question, **When** the action is performed, **Then** all player devices and TV displays update within 300ms to show the new question
16. **Given** a player submits an answer, **When** the submission is received, **Then** the TV display updates to show "X of Y teams have answered"
17. **Given** the host pauses the game, **When** the pause action occurs, **Then** all players see a "Game Paused" message and cannot submit answers
18. **Given** the host was disconnected, **When** the disconnection occurs, **Then** the game automatically pauses and displays a "Waiting for host" message to all players

#### Score Calculation and Tie-Breaking
19. **Given** two teams both have 10 correct answers, **When** final scores are calculated, **Then** the team with the lowest cumulative answer time is ranked higher
20. **Given** a team answers questions faster than others, **When** scores are tied on points, **Then** the system uses total time taken across all questions to break the tie

### Edge Cases

#### Question Selection
- **What happens when a host has already used most questions in selected categories?**
  The system automatically supplements with questions from related categories while still ensuring no question is ever repeated for that host.

- **What happens if there are insufficient unused questions even after supplementing?**
  The system warns the host before game creation, displays the actual available question count, and allows the host to proceed with the reduced number of questions if they choose.

#### Team Management
- **What happens when a player tries to join after the game has started?**
  The player is prevented from joining and sees a message indicating the game is already in progress.

- **What happens when a player creates a team with a name that already exists in that game?**
  The system rejects the team name and prompts the player to choose a different unique name.

- **What happens when a solo player (team of 1) participates?**
  They function as both the team and the only team member, submitting answers individually.

- **What happens when a player joins a team late (before game starts) and misses the initial setup?**
  They join their team and missed questions count as incorrect for scoring purposes.

#### Answer Submission
- **What happens if multiple team members submit answers simultaneously?**
  The first answer received by the system is recorded and locked; all subsequent attempts are rejected with "Your team has already answered" message.

- **What happens if no teams submit an answer for a question?**
  The host can still reveal the correct answer and advance to the next question; all teams receive zero points for that question.

- **What happens if a time limit expires before any team answers?**
  The system auto-advances to reveal the correct answer following normal game flow; teams that didn't answer receive zero points.

#### Disconnection Handling
- **What happens when a player disconnects mid-game?**
  The player's device attempts to auto-reconnect. If successful, they rejoin their team automatically. Questions missed during disconnection are not penalized (not counted as incorrect). Other team members can continue answering.

- **What happens if auto-reconnect fails?**
  The player sees a "Reconnect" button to manually attempt reconnection to rejoin their team.

- **What happens when the host disconnects?**
  The game automatically pauses. All players see "Game Paused - Waiting for host" message. When the host reconnects, they can resume the game from the paused state.

- **What happens when a TV display disconnects?**
  The system automatically reconnects the TV display silently in the background without notifying the host. The reconnection is seamless and does not interrupt gameplay.

#### Game State Management
- **What happens when a host accidentally advances past a question?**
  The host can navigate backward to previous questions. Previously submitted answers are preserved and displayed.

- **What happens when a host ends the game early before all rounds complete?**
  Final scores are calculated and displayed based only on completed rounds. Incomplete rounds are not counted.

- **What happens when a host wants to preview the next question before displaying it?**
  The host can privately view the upcoming question and has the option to replace it with another question from the same category before displaying to players.

- **What happens when a host replaces or skips a question?**
  Skipped/replaced questions do not count toward the round's question total and are not shown to players.

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **What happens when a player chooses anonymous login?**
  They enter just their name and receive a temporary anonymous session that remains valid for the game duration plus 30 days after game completion.

- **What happens when a registered player logs in from multiple devices?**
  The system allows multi-device login with synchronized state across all devices. Players can be logged in simultaneously on multiple devices and their game state remains synchronized.

- **What happens when a host tries to view or manage another host's game?**
  The system denies access and displays an authorization error.

- **What happens when someone tries to delete a game?**
  Only the host who created the game can delete it. Other hosts and players cannot delete games.

#### Data & History
- **What happens when a player views their game history?**
  They see a list of games they participated in, their team names, scores, and rankings, but NOT the actual question content or answers.

- **What happens when a host views their past games?**
  They see full game details including all questions, answers, team names, scores, and player participation.

- **What happens when game data is saved?**
  All completed games are permanently saved with no automatic deletion policy.

#### Network & Performance
- **What happens when an answer submission fails due to network issues?**
  The system automatically retries the submission. A loading state is shown during retry attempts. If submission ultimately fails, an error message is displayed to the player.

## 🚀 How to Run Tests

### Quick Start (First Time)

1. **Create test users in Supabase:**
   ```
   e2e-host@triviaparty.test / TestHost123!
   e2e-player1@triviaparty.test / TestPlayer123!
   e2e-player2@triviaparty.test / TestPlayer123!
   e2e-player3@triviaparty.test / TestPlayer123!
   ```

2. **Start dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Run first test (debug mode):**
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e:debug -- tests/e2e/scenarios/01-complete-game-flow.spec.ts
   ```

   This opens Playwright Inspector - click **Play** to watch the test execute!

## 🎯 Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. Multi-User Parallel Testing
- ✅ Host + 2-4 players + TV display simultaneously
- ✅ Complete session isolation (separate cookies/JWT/WebSocket)
- ✅ Mobile (players) vs Desktop (host) vs TV (1080p) viewports

### 2. Real-Time Sync Validation
- ✅ <300ms latency measurement and assertion
- ✅ State consistency checks across all clients
- ✅ WebSocket event synchronization testing

### 3. Network Condition Simulation
- ✅ Slow-3G (2000ms latency) - game remains functional
- ✅ 3G (300ms latency) - sync still meets requirements
- ✅ Offline/online transitions
- ✅ Disconnect/reconnect scenarios

### 4. Race Condition Testing
- ✅ 4 concurrent answer submissions
- ✅ First-write-wins database constraint validation
- ✅ 409 Conflict API response verification
- ✅ Error message display to losing players

### 5. Automatic Test Data Management
- ✅ Pre-test cleanup (delete old test games)
- ✅ Post-test cleanup (delete current test games)
- ✅ Cleanup by naming pattern (games with "e2e" or "test")
- ✅ Safe cleanup (catches errors, doesn't fail tests)

### 6. Page Object Pattern
- ✅ Reusable, maintainable test code
- ✅ Centralized element locators
- ✅ Type-safe with TypeScript
- ✅ 50+ helper methods

## 📋 Prerequisites for Running Tests

### 1. Test Users in Supabase ⚠️ REQUIRED

You **MUST** create these users before tests will work:

| Email | Password | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| `e2e-host@triviaparty.test` | `TestHost123!` | host |
| `e2e-player1@triviaparty.test` | `TestPlayer123!` | player |
| `e2e-player2@triviaparty.test` | `TestPlayer123!` | player |
| `e2e-player3@triviaparty.test` | `TestPlayer123!` | player |

**How to create:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Authentication → Users → Add User
3. Enter email and password
4. Confirm email (auto-confirm in dashboard)

### 2. UI Test IDs ⚠️ REQUIRED

Add `data-testid` attributes to your UI components:

**Host Interface:**
```tsx
<input type="email" data-testid="email-input" />
<input type="password" data-testid="password-input" />
<button data-testid="login-button">Login</button>
<button data-testid="create-game-button">Create Game</button>
<div data-testid="game-code">{gameCode}</div>
```

**Player Interface:**
```tsx
<input data-testid="game-code-input" />
<button data-testid="join-game-button">Join</button>
<div data-testid="question-text">{question}</div>
<button data-testid="answer-option-0">Answer A</button>
<div data-testid="answer-submitted-message">Submitted!</div>
```

**TV Display:**
```tsx
<div data-testid="game-code-display">{code}</div>
<div data-testid="question-text">{question}</div>
<div data-testid="teams-answered-count">{count}</div>
```

**Full list:** See `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`

### 3. Development Server

```bash
npm run dev  # Must run on port 5173
```

### 4. Database Seeding

Ensure questions table has data (61k+ questions recommended)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### ❌ "Timeout waiting for element"

**Cause:** Missing `data-testid` attribute

**Fix:** Add `data-testid="xxx"` to the element mentioned in error

---

### ❌ "Authentication failed"

**Cause:** Test users don't exist in Supabase

**Fix:** Create test users (see Prerequisites above)

---

### ❌ "Connection refused" or "net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED"

**Cause:** Dev server not running

**Fix:**
```bash
npm run dev  # In separate terminal
```

---

### ❌ "Expected sync <300ms, got 450ms"

**Cause:** Slow network or machine

**Options:**
1. Increase threshold in test (for slow CI environments)
2. Run fewer parallel workers: `npm run test:e2e -- --workers=1`
3. Close other applications

---

### ❌ "Race condition test expected 3 conflicts, got 2"

**Cause:** Timing issue - race conditions are probabilistic

**Fix:** Run test 2-3 times. This is expected behavior for race condition tests.

---

### ❌ "Database cleanup error"

**Cause:** `TEST_CLEANUP_ENABLED=false` or RLS policies

**Fix:**
```bash
# Edit .env.test
TEST_CLEANUP_ENABLED=true
```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Config-Driven Testing (Not Implemented)
**What it would do:** Allow running tests with JSON/TypeScript config files to specify:
- Number of teams (1-10)
- Players per team (1-6)
- Question count (1-50)
- Edge case injection (disconnects, race conditions)

**Estimated effort:** 3-4 hours

**Current workaround:** Modify test files directly

---

### CI/CD Integration (Not Implemented)
**What you'd add:** GitHub Actions workflow to run tests on every PR

**Example workflow:**
```yaml
name: E2E Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx playwright install --with-deps
      - run: npm run test:e2e
        env:
          VITE_SUPABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_URL }}
          VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY }}
```

**Estimated effort:** 1-2 hours

---

### Visual Regression Testing (Not Implemented)
**What it would do:** Screenshot comparison to catch UI regressions

**Tools:** Percy, Chromatic, or Playwright's built-in screenshot comparison

**Estimated effort:** 4-5 hours
